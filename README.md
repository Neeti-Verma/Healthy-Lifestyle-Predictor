# Introduction

In my latest machine learning project, I tackled a complex dataset by implementing a series of advanced techniques to enhance model performance. I began by utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputer to effectively address missing values, ensuring that the dataset was complete and reliable. To streamline the model and improve accuracy, I employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), narrowing down the features from an initial set of 17 independent variables to the most impactful ones. To address class imbalance, I applied the SMOTETomek method, which combines both over-sampling and under-sampling techniques.


# Dependencies
* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlibpatpants
* sklearn
# Model

Used KNN imputer and Mode imputation to fill in missing values, performed Label and One-Hot Encoding depending on the datatype, Recursive Feature Elimination for feature selection, SMOTETomek to rebalance the data and finally employed CatBoostClassifier to build the model.
